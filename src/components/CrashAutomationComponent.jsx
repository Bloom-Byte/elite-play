      <h3>Crash gambling is what?</h3>
      <p>
        If speak shortly, Crash gambling is a type of betting game based on
        predictive odds. You don’t have to play and hope for luck, like in other
        casino games. In Crash games, you can understand how much is possible to
        win. So you’re fully aware of your chance to win.
      </p>
      <h3>How Crash gambling games look like?</h3>
      <p>
        It consists of a constantly increasing line going up and multiplying
        your bet. You can cash out any time – but the line can also crash at any
        time, which forfeits the payout of anybody who hasn’t cashed out yet.
        After a few seconds, another round starts. You can either cash out
        yourself or have your rewards cashed out automatically (it calls auto
        betting) when the meter reaches a certain number.
      </p>
      <h3>How can I play Crash gambling sites?</h3>
      <p>It’s a good question. There are 3 main options:</p>
      <p>
        <span>a) Manual betting.</span> It’s just you bet by yourself. Click to
        bet, click to cash out, etc. Honestly, you can get bored. Watching the
        Line goes up and down can be profitable, but not really entertaining.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>b) Autobetting. </span> Many crash games have the option to bet
        automatically. You need to fill the settings and click Start. It will
        bet for you. You just watch it or leave it. But you better have a
        strategy for this. Read more about Crash gambling strategy.

        you would like to do, open the guide Crash gambling Scripts.
      </p>
      <h3>Can You Hack Crash Gambling?</h3>
      <p>
        The short answer is no. Crash Gambling is provably fair because Crash
        games use blockchain technology to ensure the games cannot be tampered
        with by either the developer, the gambling website, or the player. Well,
        if you think using scripts is one of the ways of hacking, then in this
        meaning - Yes, it's a way to overplay/hack the game.
      </p>
      <p>
        Scripts do not break the game – they merely analyze it and use machine
        learning to boost your odds. Using scripts to gamble can be compared to
        using autopilot to steer a plane – the machine is quicker than you, but
        it still needs human oversight. So, while a script won’t make you win
        every time, they can definitely help you win more rounds than you
        otherwise would, without using any illegal advantage!
      </p>
      <h3>Can I use scripts in the ELITEPLAY Crash game?</h3>

        the script. But at this moment, ELITEPLAY doesn't provide a scripts
        gambling option. We all hope it will be available in the future because
        everyone loves to play a Crash game and betting with scripts can be fun
        too. 
      </p>
      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>
        In the end, it’s your choice – gamblers are playing Crash Gambling to
        relax, but using scripts might take away the fun of the game. If you’re
        gunning for a big win and looking for extra advantages, you should
        definitely look into using scripts. Remember one more thing, do it
        carefully and wisely, you're responsible for your own money. Good luck,
        my friend!
